This will create 5 joined events for the test user in the Database from the last 5 events available. It does not change anything on the underlying events.

Run this in the database:

INSERT INTO joined_events (event_id, event_joinuser) SELECT event_id, 'user1' FROM event ORDER BY event_id DESC LIMIT 5
