# Full Feature Release Info:

This version of GetTogether has all the necessary main functionalities. Users can create events with a title, times, locations, descriptions. The events will then be displayed in a list accessible to any other users of the app. Users can view events from this list, and all of the aforementioned information about any event will be visible. The login feature is functional, and only requires that users not create usernames that have already been taken. Users can log out from the home screen, and they can also access a help button that downloads a relevant PDF in this repository. The PDF contains information to help navigagte through the app.
Unit Test are available in a file in the repository.

# Design Patterns/Principles

We have a couple different design and architectural philosophies woven into our app and code. For our overall architecture, our app most closely resembles the MVC (Model, View, Controller) architectural philosophy. When using GetTogether, a user will provide information to the “model,” or the app interface. The app takes that data and uses it to manipulate what pins will be displayed on the Google Maps within the app. Then, the user will see through the UI that the map has been updated, and the event that they created is showing up in the correct location on the map.

As for the life cycle of the development of GetTogether, we most closely followed the staged delivery model. This means that our work was done in stages up until a certain point, at which we transitioned to getting the remaining work done in sections instead of stages. More specifically, we determined our requirements and design for the entire app in order. After we completed the design for all components of our app, we began working on one piece at a time to implement, test, and then maintain. 

First, we focused on setting up our UI and buttons in order to meet the requirements of the Zero Feature Release, and give ourselves a good base to continue working on the app. Then, we implemented the Google Maps component of the app. The map is arguably the most important part of the app, so we needed to incorporate it early on to ensure that it worked as needed. Then, we worked on the login feature, along with the database needed to store all the usernames and passwords of users. 

When designing our UI, we made sure to put an emphasis on simplicity and using as few pages as possible. There are only about 4-5 different screens used in our app, and there isn’t a need for much more than that. The page with the Google Maps displays most of the info needed for usage of the app in an easily accessible and readable format. The UI components we used were buttons and text fields. There are small amounts of information that users need to input themselves, and the range of things that could be inputted is large. Therefore, text boxes were the best choices. Buttons made for an easy-to-use way of navigating the app.


# Design Changes and Rationale

Most of the features cut were due to time restraints and the capabilities of the team. 

Removed Features:

-User Profile

The user profile seemed superfluous, and was a reasonable feature to cut in the interest of time. The user profile could have provided app users with an additional way to connect with peers and ease the process of setting up events, but ultimately, it is an unnecessary component in respect to the functionality of the app as a whole.

-Search bar for Search Event

The search bar was one of the more key features of our app, but it had to be cut in the interest of time. It also would have been a more difficult feature to code, and the app can still function well without it. It may be added back in before final release if time allows.

-Filter Event Categories

In our original design, we planned to have a feature that would allow users to filter events by category while they were searching for events. For example, there would be categories like “Sports,” “Art,” “Studying,” etc. We decided that this feature was not necessary unless the app gained popularity and had more users. If there are a small amount of events in a given area to begin with, there is not much use in being able to filter out the events by category. This feature may be implemented in the future if needed.

-Event attendees count

We originally planned for events to keep a count of users who planned to attend the event. Whenever a user would “join” an event, the count of people for said event would increase by one. We ended up deciding that this feature was largely unnecessary, and provided little use to users who both created and were looking for events.

-Map and Event Pins

The map feature of GetTogether was removed after it broke following the release of Version 1.0.3. We attempted to fix it, but we were not able to, and decided on an alternative for the location of the events instead. 

Added Features:

-PDF of Sacramento State added to Map page

Instead of the Google Maps on the map page, we added a pdf of Sacramento State University's Campus with labels. This indirectly restricts the usablity of our app to the Sac State campus, and circumvents the issues we were running into with getting Google Maps to function correctly.
